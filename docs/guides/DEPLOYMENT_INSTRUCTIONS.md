# 🚀 Deployment Instructions

## Your Changes Are Ready But Not Live Yet

All your changes are committed and pushed to the `copilot/add-pose-snapshot-system` branch, but they're not appearing on the live site because **production deploys from the `main` branch**.

---

## Quick Fix (2 Steps)

### 1. Create Pull Request on GitHub
- Go to: https://github.com/Yorisounai20/Canvas-Visualizer
- Click "Pull Requests" → "New Pull Request"
- Set: `main` ← `copilot/add-pose-snapshot-system`
- Create and merge the PR

### 2. Wait for Deployment
- Vercel automatically deploys `main` branch
- Wait 2-5 minutes
- Hard refresh your site (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- ✅ Changes will appear!

## Why This Happens

```
Your Changes:  copilot/add-pose-snapshot-system branch ✅
Live Site:     main branch ❌
Solution:      Merge feature branch → main
