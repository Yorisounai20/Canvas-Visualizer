---

## **How It Works**

### **Audio Analysis:**
1. Loads audio file into Web Audio API
2. Uses FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) to analyze frequencies in real-time
3. Splits frequencies into 3 bands:
   - **Bass** (0-10 bins) - affects large central objects
   - **Mids** (10-100 bins) - affects medium-sized objects  
   - **Highs** (100-200 bins) - affects small particles/details

### **3D Rendering:**
- Built with Three.js (WebGL)
- 960x540 canvas (16:9 aspect ratio)
- Fog effect for depth
- **Material system (Software Mode):**
  - **Basic (MeshBasicMaterial)** - Unlit, flat shading, always visible
  - **Standard (MeshStandardMaterial)** - PBR with metalness and roughness, responds to lighting
  - **Phong (MeshPhongMaterial)** - Specular highlights, classic shiny materials
  - **Lambert (MeshLambertMaterial)** - Diffuse matte shading, soft appearance
- Wireframe rendering mode (per-shape toggle)
- Geometric primitives: Cubes, Octahedrons, Tetrahedrons, Spheres
- **Skybox rendering (Software Mode):**
  - Solid color backgrounds
  - Gradient backgrounds with GLSL shaders
  - Equirectangular image mapping for 360° panoramas
  - Procedural star fields, galaxies, and nebulae using THREE.Points and custom shaders

### **Animation System:**
Each preset controls:
- Camera position and movement
- Object positions, rotations, scales
- Object opacity based on audio
- Material colors from user-selected palette
- Smooth blending when switching between presets

### **Camera Rig System:**
Professional camera control with:
- **Keyframe animation** - Smooth interpolation between camera positions
- **Four rig types** - Orbit, Dolly, Crane, and Custom rigs
- **Easing functions** - Linear, Ease In, Ease Out, Ease In-Out
- **Camera shake** - Impact effects synchronized to audio
- **Null object hierarchy** - Professional transform composition
- **3D Path Visualization** - Real-time visual feedback of rig trajectories
  - Color-coded paths per rig type (Orbit=Cyan, Dolly=Green, Crane=Magenta, Custom=White)
  - Sphere markers at keyframe positions with size variations based on easing
  - Toggle visibility for paths and markers independently
  - Eliminates need to constantly switch between UI and viewport during setup

📚 **[Complete Camera Rig Documentation](CAMERA_RIG_DOCUMENTATION.md)**  
📖 **[Quick Reference Guide](docs/CAMERA_RIG_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)**

⚠️ **Current Status:** Animation presets are defined and objects are rendered, but the animation playback logic is not yet integrated into the new UI. Objects appear static. This is a priority for the next development phase.

- All state is in-memory only (resets on refresh)
- Cannot access local filesystem directly (must use file input)

### **In Development (Final Architecture Refactor):**
- Scene Explorer integration into main layout (created, not yet integrated)
- Canvas resize based on timeline height (planned)
- Camera settings migration to object properties (planned)
- Preset menu relocation to workspace controls (planned)
- Multiple camera implementation (type system ready)
- Form field ID additions for accessibility (planned)

## **Recent Changes & Improvements**

### **Version 2.4 - Camera Rig Path Visualization (Latest):**
- ✨ **3D Path Visualization** - Real-time visual feedback of camera rig trajectories in the viewport
  - Color-coded paths: Orbit (Cyan), Dolly (Green), Crane (Magenta), Custom (White)
